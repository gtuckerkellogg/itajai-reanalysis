## this is a quick script to highlight three important points:
## 1. there exist many people included in the analysis with symptom onset before the 7th of July
## 2. Most of the people that became ill before the 7th and then hospitalized were counted as non
## users
## 3. Hospitalised patient symptom onset data shows that the data is biased towards earlier
## infections *within* the study period
