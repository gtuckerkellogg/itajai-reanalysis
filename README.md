# Re-analysis of Itajai data accounting for multiple bias sources

## Getting the data

- download the zip file from osf.io/uxhaf into the `data/` folder and unzip into a new directory called "kerr"
- Download https://s3.sa-east-1.amazonaws.com/ckan.saude.gov.br/SRAG/2022/INFLUD20-26-09-2022.csv and put it into `/data`





## Regenerating the figures and tables

- Table 1 and Figure 1 can be generated by running `src/compare_sus_kerr.R`
- Main simulations can be built by running `src/main_simulations.R`  This can take a while.
- Figure 2 can be generated by running `src/immortal_time_bias-KC22.R`
- Table 2 can be generated by running `src/table_2.R`. 
- Table 3 can be generated by running `src/table_3.R`.
- Table 4 (the main result) and all supplemental tables can be generated by running `src/main_and_supplemental_tables.R`.
